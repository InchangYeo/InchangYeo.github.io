In-Chang Yeo is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering at Seoul National University, specializing in end-to-end autonomous navigation systems for ships. His doctoral research focuses on integrating the entire pipeline, from S-57 chart-based route planning to final automatic berthing.

His work leverages robust perception technologies, using monocular cameras for ship detection and localization, and stereo cameras to construct 3D Pseudo-LiDAR maps for complex docking maneuvers. He applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop advanced controllers for both collision avoidance and precision berthing. A core component of his methodology involves designing high-fidelity digital twin simulation environments in Unity (C#) to robustly train and validate these AI models using a sim-to-real approach.

His practical experience is validated through multiple real-world ship tests and project collaborations with key industry partners, including KRISO, Hanwha Ocean, and Avikus.
