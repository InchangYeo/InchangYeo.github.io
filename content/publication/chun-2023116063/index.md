abstract: During the building of an LNG tank, a thermal insulation panel, hereafter
  referred to as a “panel,” is installed on the inner wall to insulate the tank from
  external conditions. The inner wall of the LNG tank can experience deformations,
  leading to the panel becoming inclined and twisted, making it susceptible to damage
  and reducing its insulation effectiveness. To address this challenge, a common practice
  involves placing wedges at each corner of the panel between the inner tank wall
  and the panel, and then filling the resulting gaps with a mastic rope. However,
  this extensive use of mastic ropes to mitigate panel inclination and twisting is
  a costly solution. The primary objective of this study is to optimize the overall
  use of mastic ropes for enhanced tank insulation. This optimization is achieved
  by determining the ideal panel installation height, which is dependent on factors
  such as the wedge height, as well as panel inclination and twisting. These parameters
  serve as the objective functions and constraints for optimization. To validate the
  effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, tests were conducted by applying
  the proposed method to cover the inner wall of an LNG tank with insulation panels.
  The study considered four cases, each focusing on different objective functions
  related to the economic feasibility and safety of LNG tanks, and compared the results.
  In the most cost-effective solution, the total use of mastic ropes was reduced by
  approximately 42% compared to the conventional manual design. Furthermore, safety-related
  solutions demonstrated improved safety levels compared to the manual design, with
  only a marginal 0.1% change in the total use of mastic ropes. Lastly, in cases where
  both economic feasibility and safety were considered, improvements were observed
  in both aspects compared to the manual design.
