abstract: Planning safe and efficient routes for small ships inside the marina is
  essential. However, existing route planning methods have been primarily developed
  for commercial ships and, therefore, fail to adequately capture the unique navigational
  characteristics of small ships. To address this limitation, this study proposed
  a route planning method for small ships navigating inside the marina. The proposed
  method generated centerline charts based on a Voronoi diagram. Here, the Voronoi
  diagram was generated from the integrated nautical charts, which comprehensively
  account for various features inside the marina. Then, the A∗ algorithm was applied
  by incorporating water depth to plan the optimal route. Furthermore, postprocessing
  of the planned route was introduced to account for the dredged area and the port-to-port
  passing rules at marina entrances, including route smoothing. Finally, the proposed
  method was applied to a marina near the Miami region to evaluate its effectiveness.
  The results demonstrate that, unlike existing methods, the proposed method successfully
  considers water depth, dredged area, and port-to-port passing rules at marina entrances
  while also maintaining a safety distance from the shoreline, all within a short
  computation time. Accordingly, the proposed method is expected to enhance the safety
  and efficiency of small ships navigating inside the marina.
