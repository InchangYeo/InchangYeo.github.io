abstract: Designing a hull form typically involves beginning with a reference hull
  form based on ship owner requirements, editing the hull form to satisfy the requirements,
  and determining the most efficient hull form. Numerical analyses using Computational
  Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were employed to assess the performance of the hull form. However,
  these analyses require extensive computational resources, making it challenging
  to perform thorough analyses within the design timeframe. To address this issue,
  this paper proposes an approach that involves defining a range of hull forms with
  characteristic curves, predicting their performance using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
  and subsequently determining the optimal hull form based on these predictions. Initially,
  the hull form of a small ship was defined using four characteristic curves and parameterized
  using 29 variables. Fairness optimization was performed using these characteristic
  curves to define the hull form surface. By varying 29 parameters, 896 different
  hull forms were generated, with CFD analysis conducted for each variant. These data
  were then used to build a DNN model capable of predicting the performance based
  on hull form parameters. The accuracy of the DNN model was evaluated, resulting
  in a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.835%. Subsequently, the DNN model is combined
  with a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal set of parameters for the hull
  form, resulting in an optimal hull form. This optimization process revealed that
  the optimal hull form reduced the total hydrodynamic resistance by approximately
  7% compared to the initial reference design. Consequently, this study demonstrates
  the effectiveness of the proposed method for deriving the optimal hull form for
  small ships.
