abstract: When designing the hull form of a commercial ship, it is common practice
  to make manual adjustments to the shape of an existing reference hull form to meet
  design requirements. In efforts to generate a variety of hull forms, many shape
  optimization studies have either defined the hull form using parameters or directly
  modified the surface of the hull form, allowing for more flexible deformations.
  Recently, there has also been a surge of research utilizing deep learning-based
  generative models to generate new hull forms based on existing hull forms. While
  these methods offer more flexibility in shape deformation than traditional approaches,
  they have the limitation of needing to account for design requirements such as displacement
  and block coefficient of a ship. In this study, to address these limitations, we
  proposed a hull form generation method that enabled the simultaneous generation
  of multiple hull forms using MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) from deep learning. The
  MLP was used to deform the hull form, and a triangular mesh structure of the hull
  form was employed for surface-based evaluation. Evaluation metrics included block
  coefficient, which is related to design requirements, the position of the center
  of buoyancy to promote the generation of diverse hull forms, and fairness, which
  relates to surface quality. By applying the proposed method, we were able to generate
  a variety of hull surfaces that met design requirements from a single mesh input.
  To validate the method, we applied it to publicly available hull forms such as the
  KCS (KRISO Container Ship), KVLCC2 (KRISO Very Large Crude Oil Carrier), and JBC
  (Japan Bulk Carrier). The results verified that the method successfully generated
  diverse hull forms while satisfying design requirements across multiple ship types.
