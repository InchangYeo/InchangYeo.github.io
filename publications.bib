abstract = {Planning safe and efficient routes for small ships inside the marina is essential. However, existing route planning methods have been primarily developed for commercial ships and, therefore, fail to adequately capture the unique navigational characteristics of small ships. To address this limitation, this study proposed a route planning method for small ships navigating inside the marina. The proposed method generated centerline charts based on a Voronoi diagram. Here, the Voronoi diagram was generated from the integrated nautical charts, which comprehensively account for various features inside the marina. Then, the A∗ algorithm was applied by incorporating water depth to plan the optimal route. Furthermore, postprocessing of the planned route was introduced to account for the dredged area and the port-to-port passing rules at marina entrances, including route smoothing. Finally, the proposed method was applied to a marina near the Miami region to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate that, unlike existing methods, the proposed method successfully considers water depth, dredged area, and port-to-port passing rules at marina entrances while also maintaining a safety distance from the shoreline, all within a short computation time. Accordingly, the proposed method is expected to enhance the safety and efficiency of small ships navigating inside the marina.}

abstract = {The hydrodynamic performance of a hull form is a crucial factor in the design process, and optimizing it typically requires computationally expensive and time-consuming CFD analyses. To overcome this issue, numerous approaches have been explored to efficiently handle hull forms characterized by high-dimensional parameter spaces and mitigate the associated computational complexity. In this study, we proposed a method that enables efficient optimization without restricting the degrees of freedom of the hull form. First, we introduced a hull form generation approach utilizing an MLP, allowing each vertex of the hull mesh to serve as a design variable and move freely. By directly incorporating hydrodynamic performance-related terms into the loss function of the MLP, our method enables effective searches for optimal solutions even in high-dimensional design spaces. Additionally, we considered design constraints, such as block coefficient (CB) and longitudinal center of buoyancy (LCB), and hull form surface quality, such as fairness, throughout the hull form generation and optimization process. To evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of hull forms efficiently, we constructed and employed a surrogate model that incorporates a dimensionality reduction technique based on geometric moments. Finally, we applied the proposed hull form optimization method to the publicly available KCS (KRISO Container Ship) hull form. The results demonstrated that our approach successfully explores hull forms that enhance hydrodynamic performance while leveraging high-dimensional design variables.}

abstract = {When designing the hull form of a commercial ship, it is common practice to make manual adjustments to the shape of an existing reference hull form to meet design requirements. In efforts to generate a variety of hull forms, many shape optimization studies have either defined the hull form using parameters or directly modified the surface of the hull form, allowing for more flexible deformations. Recently, there has also been a surge of research utilizing deep learning-based generative models to generate new hull forms based on existing hull forms. While these methods offer more flexibility in shape deformation than traditional approaches, they have the limitation of needing to account for design requirements such as displacement and block coefficient of a ship. In this study, to address these limitations, we proposed a hull form generation method that enabled the simultaneous generation of multiple hull forms using MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) from deep learning. The MLP was used to deform the hull form, and a triangular mesh structure of the hull form was employed for surface-based evaluation. Evaluation metrics included block coefficient, which is related to design requirements, the position of the center of buoyancy to promote the generation of diverse hull forms, and fairness, which relates to surface quality. By applying the proposed method, we were able to generate a variety of hull surfaces that met design requirements from a single mesh input. To validate the method, we applied it to publicly available hull forms such as the KCS (KRISO Container Ship), KVLCC2 (KRISO Very Large Crude Oil Carrier), and JBC (Japan Bulk Carrier). The results verified that the method successfully generated diverse hull forms while satisfying design requirements across multiple ship types.}

abstract = {Route planning for large commercial ships generally revolves around economic factors, such as fuel consumption and travel distance, which are often influenced by maritime weather conditions. In contrast, small ships navigating coastal areas, such as yachts, prioritize safety and navigational convenience. Although extensive research has been conducted on route planning for commercial ships, more studies focusing on small ships are required. This study introduces a novel route planning method for coastal areas tailored to small ships. The proposed method begins by generating quadtree charts derived from an S-57 chart. Considering the lower computational performance typically observed for small ships, a quadtree chart offers a more efficient solution than a traditional regular grid. This structure allows for high-resolution representation only where necessary, considering water depth and coastal obstacles to ensure safe navigation. The route planning process comprises two layers: high-level and low-level. The high-level layer uses lower-resolution charts to outline a general route between the departure and arrival points and to identify key entrances along the way. The low-level layer, which employs higher-resolution charts, generates a detailed route from the departure point to the entrance and from the entrance to the arrival point. The final step involves smoothing to ensure a seamless and navigationally efficient route. Adopting a hierarchical approach can significantly enhance the efficiency of route planning by utilizing a multi-level structure, thereby reducing the time required for route planning. This methodology enables more effective responses in continuous maritime environments, ensuring high efficiency even during real-time route updates and modifications. The proposed method was applied to the coastal areas of the Republic of Korea to assess its effectiveness. In this study, the proposed method was compared with conventional chart generation methods. The results demonstrate that the method provides suitable and safe route planning for small ships, offering a reliable approach for coastal area navigation.}

abstract = {Safe navigation of ships depends on the accurate recognition and tracking of nearby maritime obstacles as detected by various sensors. Challenges arise in tracking maritime obstacles from sensor data because of sensor noise and incomplete sensor data. Traditionally, tracking algorithms such as the EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) have been applied to track the state of maritime obstacles, including the position, COG (Course Over Ground), and SOG (Speed Over Ground). This study implemented a combined EKF- and learning-based (hybrid) tracking method. In the EKF-based method, the parameters are related to the uncertainty of the system and the sensor data. These parameters are generally set manually by analyzing the noise of the sensor data and may not be optimal; we optimized the parameters to compensate for this. In the learning-based method, we trained a deep learning model using a DNN (Deep Neural Network) to predict obstacle states from sensor measurement data. We then propose a hybrid tracking method that combines the two tracking methods to compensate for the shortcomings of each method. We verified these three tracking methods using navigation data obtained through field tests. The verification results showed that the learning-based tracking method improved the SOG tracking accuracy by 11.47% compared with the traditional EKF-based tracking method. The tracking accuracy of the hybrid tracking method was reduced by 22.42% for the COG and 42.05% for the SOG. These results indicate that the hybrid tracking method effectively compensates for the limitations of the other methods, resulting in an enhanced tracking performance.}

abstract = {Designing a hull form typically involves beginning with a reference hull form based on ship owner requirements, editing the hull form to satisfy the requirements, and determining the most efficient hull form. Numerical analyses using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were employed to assess the performance of the hull form. However, these analyses require extensive computational resources, making it challenging to perform thorough analyses within the design timeframe. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach that involves defining a range of hull forms with characteristic curves, predicting their performance using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and subsequently determining the optimal hull form based on these predictions. Initially, the hull form of a small ship was defined using four characteristic curves and parameterized using 29 variables. Fairness optimization was performed using these characteristic curves to define the hull form surface. By varying 29 parameters, 896 different hull forms were generated, with CFD analysis conducted for each variant. These data were then used to build a DNN model capable of predicting the performance based on hull form parameters. The accuracy of the DNN model was evaluated, resulting in a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.835%. Subsequently, the DNN model is combined with a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal set of parameters for the hull form, resulting in an optimal hull form. This optimization process revealed that the optimal hull form reduced the total hydrodynamic resistance by approximately 7% compared to the initial reference design. Consequently, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for deriving the optimal hull form for small ships.}

abstract = {During the building of an LNG tank, a thermal insulation panel, hereafter referred to as a “panel,” is installed on the inner wall to insulate the tank from external conditions. The inner wall of the LNG tank can experience deformations, leading to the panel becoming inclined and twisted, making it susceptible to damage and reducing its insulation effectiveness. To address this challenge, a common practice involves placing wedges at each corner of the panel between the inner tank wall and the panel, and then filling the resulting gaps with a mastic rope. However, this extensive use of mastic ropes to mitigate panel inclination and twisting is a costly solution. The primary objective of this study is to optimize the overall use of mastic ropes for enhanced tank insulation. This optimization is achieved by determining the ideal panel installation height, which is dependent on factors such as the wedge height, as well as panel inclination and twisting. These parameters serve as the objective functions and constraints for optimization. To validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, tests were conducted by applying the proposed method to cover the inner wall of an LNG tank with insulation panels. The study considered four cases, each focusing on different objective functions related to the economic feasibility and safety of LNG tanks, and compared the results. In the most cost-effective solution, the total use of mastic ropes was reduced by approximately 42% compared to the conventional manual design. Furthermore, safety-related solutions demonstrated improved safety levels compared to the manual design, with only a marginal 0.1% change in the total use of mastic ropes. Lastly, in cases where both economic feasibility and safety were considered, improvements were observed in both aspects compared to the manual design.}

abstract = {Ships are generally designed by modifying and improving base ships, and the design process includes designing the arrangement of pipeline layout and supports. The pipeline must be placed within a limited compartment because of the features of a ship with limited space. Therefore, the designer must arrange the pipeline by considering various factors, such as the connection between the equipment, efficiency, space utilization, and economic feasibility. Several stress analysis conditions must be satisfied to ensure the pipeline safety, and the arrangement of pipeline supports must be modified according to the stress analysis results. In this study, we proposed a method for optimizing the arrangement design of pipeline supports, considering safety and production costs. First, we set the type of pipeline support—whether to install the pipeline support on each node and whether to change the loop length as a design variable. In general, efficiently installing pipeline supports will improve safety and reduce production costs. Moreover, installing more pipeline supports than necessary limits the flexibility of the pipeline and reduces its safety. Therefore, safety and economy should be considered when installing pipeline supports. However, it is challenging to satisfy both conditions simultaneously with the conventional manual arrangement design methods for pipeline support. In this study, the pipeline support arrangement design process was formulated as an optimization problem to derive an optimal arrangement design. The objective function was set considering the safety and production cost, and the stress analysis conditions of the pipeline were set as constraints to ensure the safety of the derived arrangement design. By solving the formalized optimal arrangement design problem described above, an optimal arrangement design for pipeline support that meets the design purpose was derived. Finally, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to an actual pipeline. Consequently, it was confirmed that the optimal pipeline support arrangement design could be derived by considering both the safety and economic feasibility of the pipeline.}

abstract = {When designing a ship's hull form, a designer creates various candidate hull forms and performs a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to evaluate the performance of each candidate. Designers consider quantitative indicators, such as the total resistance and wake coefficient, and qualitative indicators, such as the wave height and pressure distributions, when evaluating the performance of a hull form. During the design process, quantitative and qualitative indicators are often used to determine the superiority of two hull forms. However, in the case of quantitative indicators, the difference between the two hull forms is often minimal; thus, superiority cannot be readily determined. Furthermore, because qualitative indicators are in the form of images, it is challenging to determine the superiority in many cases, even for experienced designers. To solve this problem, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for predicting the superiority of hull form performance from a qualitative indicator of the image form derived from CFD analysis. The proposed prediction model received various types of hull form performance images. From these results, the hull form performance characteristics were well fused for prediction with high accuracy. CFD analysis images and quantitative indicators for 1600 hull forms were used to determine the superiority of the prediction model. The learned model was verified using 240 hulls. The result confirmed that the proposed model accurately predicted superiority with an accuracy of approximately 94%.}
