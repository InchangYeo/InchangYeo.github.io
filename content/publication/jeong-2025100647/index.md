abstract: 'Route planning for large commercial ships generally revolves around economic
  factors, such as fuel consumption and travel distance, which are often influenced
  by maritime weather conditions. In contrast, small ships navigating coastal areas,
  such as yachts, prioritize safety and navigational convenience. Although extensive
  research has been conducted on route planning for commercial ships, more studies
  focusing on small ships are required. This study introduces a novel route planning
  method for coastal areas tailored to small ships. The proposed method begins by
  generating quadtree charts derived from an S-57 chart. Considering the lower computational
  performance typically observed for small ships, a quadtree chart offers a more efficient
  solution than a traditional regular grid. This structure allows for high-resolution
  representation only where necessary, considering water depth and coastal obstacles
  to ensure safe navigation. The route planning process comprises two layers: high-level
  and low-level. The high-level layer uses lower-resolution charts to outline a general
  route between the departure and arrival points and to identify key entrances along
  the way. The low-level layer, which employs higher-resolution charts, generates
  a detailed route from the departure point to the entrance and from the entrance
  to the arrival point. The final step involves smoothing to ensure a seamless and
  navigationally efficient route. Adopting a hierarchical approach can significantly
  enhance the efficiency of route planning by utilizing a multi-level structure, thereby
  reducing the time required for route planning. This methodology enables more effective
  responses in continuous maritime environments, ensuring high efficiency even during
  real-time route updates and modifications. The proposed method was applied to the
  coastal areas of the Republic of Korea to assess its effectiveness. In this study,
  the proposed method was compared with conventional chart generation methods. The
  results demonstrate that the method provides suitable and safe route planning for
  small ships, offering a reliable approach for coastal area navigation.'
