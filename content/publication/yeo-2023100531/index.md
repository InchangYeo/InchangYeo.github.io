abstract: Ships are generally designed by modifying and improving base ships, and
  the design process includes designing the arrangement of pipeline layout and supports.
  The pipeline must be placed within a limited compartment because of the features
  of a ship with limited space. Therefore, the designer must arrange the pipeline
  by considering various factors, such as the connection between the equipment, efficiency,
  space utilization, and economic feasibility. Several stress analysis conditions
  must be satisfied to ensure the pipeline safety, and the arrangement of pipeline
  supports must be modified according to the stress analysis results. In this study,
  we proposed a method for optimizing the arrangement design of pipeline supports,
  considering safety and production costs. First, we set the type of pipeline support—whether
  to install the pipeline support on each node and whether to change the loop length
  as a design variable. In general, efficiently installing pipeline supports will
  improve safety and reduce production costs. Moreover, installing more pipeline supports
  than necessary limits the flexibility of the pipeline and reduces its safety. Therefore,
  safety and economy should be considered when installing pipeline supports. However,
  it is challenging to satisfy both conditions simultaneously with the conventional
  manual arrangement design methods for pipeline support. In this study, the pipeline
  support arrangement design process was formulated as an optimization problem to
  derive an optimal arrangement design. The objective function was set considering
  the safety and production cost, and the stress analysis conditions of the pipeline
  were set as constraints to ensure the safety of the derived arrangement design.
  By solving the formalized optimal arrangement design problem described above, an
  optimal arrangement design for pipeline support that meets the design purpose was
  derived. Finally, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying
  it to an actual pipeline. Consequently, it was confirmed that the optimal pipeline
  support arrangement design could be derived by considering both the safety and economic
  feasibility of the pipeline.
